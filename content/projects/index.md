## Software

You can find all my open source software project on my [GitHub](https://github.com/eliobou).

### Todoist AI Summary
An automated tool that generates a smart weekly summary of your completed Todoist tasks and sends it to you via email. I wrote an [article](https://eliobou.com/posts/todolist-management/) on this project.

### Strava Progress Dashboard

### Video Call Warner MQTT

Video Call Warner is a smart office notifier that lets your coworkers know whether you're available or currently in a video call. Using a simple web interface, you can toggle your status, which controls an LED indicator (green/red) outside your office door via MQTT.
