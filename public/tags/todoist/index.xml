      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always had a complicated relationship with todo lists. You know the drill: you start with good intentions, add tasks as they come up, and then&amp;hellip; nothing. Tasks pile up, priorities blur, and before you know it, you&amp;rsquo;re looking at a 50-item list where everything feels equally urgent and equally impossible. Eventually, you just stop looking at it altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, I cycled through this pattern. I&amp;rsquo;d try a new system, feel productive for a week or two, then watch it slowly decay into chaos. The problem wasn&amp;rsquo;t the tools or my motivation. It was that I had no real method to keep things under control and no way to see what I was actually accomplishing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
