But here\u0026rsquo;s the thing: I don\u0026rsquo;t obsess over due dates when I capture tasks. When something comes up, I throw it into the appropriate project and move on. No stress, no overthinking.\nThe real work happens each morning. I go through my projects and select 5 to 7 tasks for the day. That\u0026rsquo;s it. Not 3, not 15. This range is the sweet spot I\u0026rsquo;ve found where I stay productive without setting myself up for failure.\nWhy this number? It\u0026rsquo;s enough to feel like I\u0026rsquo;m making real progress, but realistic enough that I can actually get it all done. I\u0026rsquo;m not just blindly stacking tasks anymore. Each selection is deliberate. It forces me to think about what truly matters today.\nThe Two-Delay Rule Of course, life happens. Sometimes a task doesn\u0026rsquo;t get done. When that happens, I push it to the next day and start with it first thing in the morning. No big deal.\nBut if I push the same task twice?

WireGuard is setup but I can\u0026rsquo;t access anything. This frustrating situation is often caused by a subnet conflict that\u0026rsquo;s invisible at first glance.\nUnderstanding the Problem When your VPN won\u0026rsquo;t route traffic despite being \u0026ldquo;connected,\u0026rdquo; the issue is usually that your current network and your home network use the same IP subnet. For example, if both networks use 192.168.1.0/24, your device doesn\u0026rsquo;t know whether 192.168.1.23 refers to a local device or one back home through the VPN.\nQuick Diagnosis Check if the VPN tunnel works First, connect to the VPN and verify the VPN connection itself is functional:\n# Ping the WireGuard server\u0026#39;s VPN IP ping 10.191.124.1 If this works, your VPN tunnel is fine—the problem is routing to your home network.\nIdentify the subnet conflict Check your current network\u0026rsquo;s subnet:\n# On Linux/Mac ip route | grep default # or ifconfig | grep inet # On Windows ipconfig If you see 192.168.1.x and your home network also uses 192.168.1.x, you\u0026rsquo;ve found the cause.\nConfirm with routing table # On Mac/Linux netstat -nr | grep 192.168.1 # On Windows route print If you see multiple routes for the same subnet pointing to different interfaces, your OS doesn\u0026rsquo;t know which path to take.\nSolution 1: Allow Specific IPs Only (Quick Fix) The fastest and simplest solution is to route only specific devices through the VPN instead of the entire subnet.\nConfiguration Edit your WireGuard client config:\n[Interface] PrivateKey = YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY Address = 10.191.124.4/24 DNS = 9.9.9.9 [Peer] PublicKey = SERVER_PUBLIC_KEY Endpoint = YOUR_PUBLIC_IP:51820 # Instead of 192.168.1.0/24, use /32 for specific hosts AllowedIPs = 192.168.1.1/32, 192.168.1.23/32, 10.191.124.0/24 PersistentKeepalive = 25 What this does The /32 notation creates routes for individual IP addresses only. These specific routes take priority over your local network\u0026rsquo;s broader subnet route.\nLimitations ✅ Works from any network, even if it uses the same subnet ✅ No changes needed on the server side ❌ You must manually list each device you want to access ❌ New devices on your home network won\u0026rsquo;t be automatically accessible ❌ Dynamic IPs (DHCP) can break connections if they change (prefer assign IP address) Best for: Accessing a few specific services (Raspberry Pi, NAS, home server)\nSolution 2: Change Your Home Network Subnet (Permanent Fix) The robust solution is to change your home network to use a different subnet that won\u0026rsquo;t conflict with common networks.\nRecommended subnets 10.0.0.0/24 - Unlikely to conflict 192.168.2.0/24 - Common alternative 172.16.0.0/24 - Rarely used in home networks Steps to change Access your router (usually http://192.168.1.1) Navigate to LAN/DHCP settings Change the IP range from 192.168.1.x to 10.0.0.x (for example) Save and reboot the router Reconnect all devices (they\u0026rsquo;ll get new IPs automatically) Update WireGuard client config [Interface] PrivateKey = YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY Address = 10.191.124.4/24 DNS = 9.9.9.9 [Peer] PublicKey = SERVER_PUBLIC_KEY Endpoint = YOUR_PUBLIC_IP:51820 # Now you can use the entire subnet without conflicts AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.0/24, 10.191.124.0/24 PersistentKeepalive = 25 What this does By using a unique subnet at home, you eliminate any possibility of conflicts. When you connect to the VPN, your device knows that 10.0.0.x addresses should route through the tunnel because they don\u0026rsquo;t exist on your current local network.\nBenefits and trade-offs ✅ Access to all devices on your home network automatically ✅ Works reliably from any network worldwide ✅ New devices are immediately accessible ✅ Dynamic DHCP assignments don\u0026rsquo;t break connections ⚠️ Requires one-time router reconfiguration ⚠️ All devices need to reconnect once (automatic via DHCP) ⚠️ Need physical or remote access to your home network initially Best for: Anyone who regularly uses VPN to access their home network\nWhy not route everything through the VPN? You might consider using AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0 to route all traffic through the VPN, which would solve the subnet conflict. However:\nAll your internet traffic (Netflix, YouTube, browsing) goes through your home connection Slower performance due to double routing Unnecessary load on your home network Your home IP address is exposed for all activities This approach works but is overkill for accessing local resources.\nServer-side considerations Make sure your WireGuard server has proper forwarding configured. On your Raspberry Pi:\n# Check IP forwarding is enabled cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward # Should output: 1 # Verify iptables rules exist sudo iptables -t nat -L POSTROUTING -v -n # Should show MASQUERADE rules for your WireGuard subnet If these aren\u0026rsquo;t configured, the VPN tunnel works but traffic won\u0026rsquo;t route to your local network.\nWhich solution should you choose? Choose Solution 1 (specific IPs) if:\nYou only need to access 2-3 specific devices You can\u0026rsquo;t change your home network configuration right now You need a working solution immediately Choose Solution 2 (change subnet) if:\nYou regularly use VPN to access multiple home devices You want a reliable, permanent solution You can spend 10 minutes reconfiguring your router For most users who seriously use VPN to access their home network, changing the subnet is worth the one-time effort. It eliminates the problem permanently and provides the best long-term experience.\nConclusion Subnet conflicts are one of the most common but least obvious WireGuard issues. The connection appears to work (traffic flows, handshake succeeds), but routing fails silently. By understanding how your OS handles overlapping routes, you can quickly diagnose and fix the problem with either targeted routes or a subnet change.\nRemember: a working WireGuard connection doesn\u0026rsquo;t guarantee working routes to your destination network. Always verify your routing table matches your intentions.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/wireguard-subnet-conflicts/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYou\u0026rsquo;ve spent time setting up WireGuard on your Raspberry Pi, the connection shows as active, you see traffic in the WireGuard interface—but when you try to ping or access anything on your home network, nothing works. \u003cstrong\u003eWireGuard is setup but I can\u0026rsquo;t access anything\u003c/strong\u003e.

It eliminates the problem permanently and provides the best long-term experience.\nConclusion Subnet conflicts are one of the most common but least obvious WireGuard issues. The connection appears to work (traffic flows, handshake succeeds), but routing fails silently. By understanding how your OS handles overlapping routes, you can quickly diagnose and fix the problem with either targeted routes or a subnet change.\nRemember: a working WireGuard connection doesn\u0026rsquo;t guarantee working routes to your destination network. Always verify your routing table matches your intentions.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/wireguard-subnet-conflicts/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYou\u0026rsquo;ve spent time setting up WireGuard on your Raspberry Pi, the connection shows as active, you see traffic in the WireGuard interface—but when you try to ping or access anything on your home network, nothing works. \u003cstrong\u003eWireGuard is setup but I can\u0026rsquo;t access anything\u003c/strong\u003e.

You know the drill: you start with good intentions, add tasks as they come up, and then\u0026hellip; nothing. Tasks pile up, priorities blur, and before you know it, you\u0026rsquo;re looking at a 50-item list where everything feels equally urgent and equally impossible. Eventually, you just stop looking at it altogether.\nFor years, I cycled through this pattern. I\u0026rsquo;d try a new system, feel productive for a week or two, then watch it slowly decay into chaos. The problem wasn\u0026rsquo;t the tools or my motivation. It was that I had no real method to keep things under control and no way to see what I was actually accomplishing.\nThe Daily Discipline: 5-7 Tasks These days, I use Todoist for everything: work, personal stuff, and side projects. But here\u0026rsquo;s the thing: I don\u0026rsquo;t obsess over due dates when I capture tasks. When something comes up, I throw it into the appropriate project and move on. No stress, no overthinking.\nThe real work happens each morning. I go through my projects and select 5 to 7 tasks for the day. That\u0026rsquo;s it. Not 3, not 15. This range is the sweet spot I\u0026rsquo;ve found where I stay productive without setting myself up for failure.\nWhy this number? It\u0026rsquo;s enough to feel like I\u0026rsquo;m making real progress, but realistic enough that I can actually get it all done. I\u0026rsquo;m not just blindly stacking tasks anymore. Each selection is deliberate. It forces me to think about what truly matters today.\nThe Two-Delay Rule Of course, life happens. Sometimes a task doesn\u0026rsquo;t get done. When that happens, I push it to the next day and start with it first thing in the morning. No big deal.\nBut if I push the same task twice? That\u0026rsquo;s a red flag.\nWhen a task gets delayed twice, I stop and ask myself some hard questions:\nIs this actually a priority, or am I just keeping it around out of habit? Is it realistically achievable, or do I need to break it down? Is there something blocking me that I haven\u0026rsquo;t addressed? Why am I avoiding this? Sometimes the answer is that the task isn\u0026rsquo;t important anymore. Sometimes I realize I need more information or help from someone else. Other times, I\u0026rsquo;m just procrastinating on something difficult, and I need to face that head-on.\nThis simple rule has saved me from the endless cycle of carrying dead weight in my todo list. It\u0026rsquo;s like a built-in bullshit detector for my own planning.\nThe Weekly AI Summary Here\u0026rsquo;s where things get interesting. Every Sunday at 9 PM, a script I wrote runs automatically. It pulls all the tasks I completed during the week via the Todoist API, sends them to ChatGPT, and asks it to generate a summary. The result lands in my inbox: a clean, organized overview of my entire week.\nThis might sound like a small thing, but it\u0026rsquo;s become one of my favorite productivity tools.\nFirst, there\u0026rsquo;s the sense of accomplishment. When you\u0026rsquo;re in the middle of a busy week, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to feel like you\u0026rsquo;re not getting anywhere. But seeing everything laid out in an email, categorized and summarized, gives you a completely different perspective. You realize you actually did a lot. That feeling matters.\nSecond, it gives me visibility into where my time actually goes. I can see patterns: maybe I\u0026rsquo;m spending too much time on administrative stuff and not enough on the technical work I enjoy. Or maybe those side projects are eating up more hours than I thought. Having this data helps me make better decisions about how to allocate my time going forward.\nAnd the cost? Negligible. We\u0026rsquo;re talking cents per year to run this through ChatGPT\u0026rsquo;s API. It\u0026rsquo;s probably the best ROI of any tool in my productivity stack.\nBeyond Weekly Reflection The benefits extend beyond just feeling good about your week. These summaries become an archive of everything you\u0026rsquo;ve done. When it\u0026rsquo;s time for a weekly meeting at work, I don\u0026rsquo;t have to scramble to remember what I accomplished. I just open last week\u0026rsquo;s email.\nDuring annual reviews? Same thing. I have a searchable record of an entire year\u0026rsquo;s worth of work, organized and summarized. It\u0026rsquo;s made those conversations so much easier. Instead of vaguely gesturing at \u0026ldquo;being productive,\u0026rdquo; I can point to specific achievements and patterns of work.\nFor side projects, it\u0026rsquo;s even more valuable. When you\u0026rsquo;re working on something in your spare time, weeks can blur together. Did I actually make progress on that app, or did it just feel like it? The summaries don\u0026rsquo;t lie. They show you exactly what moved forward and what stalled.\nWhat This System Actually Does Let me be clear: this isn\u0026rsquo;t about being some hyper-optimized productivity machine. I\u0026rsquo;m not tracking every minute or gamifying my task completion. I still have lazy days. I still procrastinate sometimes.\nBut this system gives me two things I never had before: clarity and confidence.\nClarity because I know what I\u0026rsquo;m doing today and why it matters. I\u0026rsquo;m not drowning in an endless list. I\u0026rsquo;m making conscious choices about my priorities.\nConfidence because I can see my progress. Not in some abstract way, but in concrete terms. When imposter syndrome kicks in, I can look at those weekly summaries and remind myself that I\u0026rsquo;m actually getting shit done.\nThe AI summary isn\u0026rsquo;t doing my work for me. It\u0026rsquo;s just holding up a mirror so I can see what I\u0026rsquo;ve already accomplished. Sometimes that\u0026rsquo;s exactly what you need.\nGetting Started If this sounds interesting, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to replicate my exact setup. The core principles work with any todo app:\nLimit your daily tasks to a reasonable number Have a rule for tasks that keep getting delayed Find a way to review your progress regularly The AI part is optional, but I\u0026rsquo;d encourage you to try it. The script is on GitHub, and it\u0026rsquo;s straightforward to adapt to your needs. Even if you just manually review your completed tasks each week, you\u0026rsquo;ll be surprised at how much it changes your perspective.\nThe goal isn\u0026rsquo;t perfection. It\u0026rsquo;s sustainable progress. And I feel like I\u0026rsquo;ve found a system that delivers on that.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/todolist-management/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve always had a complicated relationship with todo lists.

WireGuard is setup but I can\u0026rsquo;t access anything. This frustrating situation is often caused by a subnet conflict that\u0026rsquo;s invisible at first glance.\nUnderstanding the Problem When your VPN won\u0026rsquo;t route traffic despite being \u0026ldquo;connected,\u0026rdquo; the issue is usually that your current network and your home network use the same IP subnet. For example, if both networks use 192.168.1.0/24, your device doesn\u0026rsquo;t know whether 192.168.1.23 refers to a local device or one back home through the VPN.\nQuick Diagnosis Check if the VPN tunnel works First, connect to the VPN and verify the VPN connection itself is functional:\n# Ping the WireGuard server\u0026#39;s VPN IP ping 10.191.124.1 If this works, your VPN tunnel is fine—the problem is routing to your home network.\nIdentify the subnet conflict Check your current network\u0026rsquo;s subnet:\n# On Linux/Mac ip route | grep default # or ifconfig | grep inet # On Windows ipconfig If you see 192.168.1.x and your home network also uses 192.168.1.x, you\u0026rsquo;ve found the cause.\nConfirm with routing table # On Mac/Linux netstat -nr | grep 192.168.1 # On Windows route print If you see multiple routes for the same subnet pointing to different interfaces, your OS doesn\u0026rsquo;t know which path to take.\nSolution 1: Allow Specific IPs Only (Quick Fix) The fastest and simplest solution is to route only specific devices through the VPN instead of the entire subnet.\nConfiguration Edit your WireGuard client config:\n[Interface] PrivateKey = YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY Address = 10.191.124.4/24 DNS = 9.9.9.9 [Peer] PublicKey = SERVER_PUBLIC_KEY Endpoint = YOUR_PUBLIC_IP:51820 # Instead of 192.168.1.0/24, use /32 for specific hosts AllowedIPs = 192.168.1.1/32, 192.168.1.23/32, 10.191.124.0/24 PersistentKeepalive = 25 What this does The /32 notation creates routes for individual IP addresses only. These specific routes take priority over your local network\u0026rsquo;s broader subnet route.\nLimitations ✅ Works from any network, even if it uses the same subnet ✅ No changes needed on the server side ❌ You must manually list each device you want to access ❌ New devices on your home network won\u0026rsquo;t be automatically accessible ❌ Dynamic IPs (DHCP) can break connections if they change (prefer assign IP address) Best for: Accessing a few specific services (Raspberry Pi, NAS, home server)\nSolution 2: Change Your Home Network Subnet (Permanent Fix) The robust solution is to change your home network to use a different subnet that won\u0026rsquo;t conflict with common networks.\nRecommended subnets 10.0.0.0/24 - Unlikely to conflict 192.168.2.0/24 - Common alternative 172.16.0.0/24 - Rarely used in home networks Steps to change Access your router (usually http://192.168.1.1) Navigate to LAN/DHCP settings Change the IP range from 192.168.1.x to 10.0.0.x (for example) Save and reboot the router Reconnect all devices (they\u0026rsquo;ll get new IPs automatically) Update WireGuard client config [Interface] PrivateKey = YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY Address = 10.191.124.4/24 DNS = 9.9.9.9 [Peer] PublicKey = SERVER_PUBLIC_KEY Endpoint = YOUR_PUBLIC_IP:51820 # Now you can use the entire subnet without conflicts AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.0/24, 10.191.124.0/24 PersistentKeepalive = 25 What this does By using a unique subnet at home, you eliminate any possibility of conflicts. When you connect to the VPN, your device knows that 10.0.0.x addresses should route through the tunnel because they don\u0026rsquo;t exist on your current local network.\nBenefits and trade-offs ✅ Access to all devices on your home network automatically ✅ Works reliably from any network worldwide ✅ New devices are immediately accessible ✅ Dynamic DHCP assignments don\u0026rsquo;t break connections ⚠️ Requires one-time router reconfiguration ⚠️ All devices need to reconnect once (automatic via DHCP) ⚠️ Need physical or remote access to your home network initially Best for: Anyone who regularly uses VPN to access their home network\nWhy not route everything through the VPN? You might consider using AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0 to route all traffic through the VPN, which would solve the subnet conflict. However:\nAll your internet traffic (Netflix, YouTube, browsing) goes through your home connection Slower performance due to double routing Unnecessary load on your home network Your home IP address is exposed for all activities This approach works but is overkill for accessing local resources.\nServer-side considerations Make sure your WireGuard server has proper forwarding configured. On your Raspberry Pi:\n# Check IP forwarding is enabled cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward # Should output: 1 # Verify iptables rules exist sudo iptables -t nat -L POSTROUTING -v -n # Should show MASQUERADE rules for your WireGuard subnet If these aren\u0026rsquo;t configured, the VPN tunnel works but traffic won\u0026rsquo;t route to your local network.\nWhich solution should you choose? Choose Solution 1 (specific IPs) if:\nYou only need to access 2-3 specific devices You can\u0026rsquo;t change your home network configuration right now You need a working solution immediately Choose Solution 2 (change subnet) if:\nYou regularly use VPN to access multiple home devices You want a reliable, permanent solution You can spend 10 minutes reconfiguring your router For most users who seriously use VPN to access their home network, changing the subnet is worth the one-time effort.

This frustrating situation is often caused by a subnet conflict that\u0026rsquo;s invisible at first glance.\nUnderstanding the Problem When your VPN won\u0026rsquo;t route traffic despite being \u0026ldquo;connected,\u0026rdquo; the issue is usually that your current network and your home network use the same IP subnet. For example, if both networks use 192.168.1.0/24, your device doesn\u0026rsquo;t know whether 192.168.1.23 refers to a local device or one back home through the VPN.\nQuick Diagnosis Check if the VPN tunnel works First, connect to the VPN and verify the VPN connection itself is functional:\n# Ping the WireGuard server\u0026#39;s VPN IP ping 10.191.124.1 If this works, your VPN tunnel is fine—the problem is routing to your home network.\nIdentify the subnet conflict Check your current network\u0026rsquo;s subnet:\n# On Linux/Mac ip route | grep default # or ifconfig | grep inet # On Windows ipconfig If you see 192.168.1.x and your home network also uses 192.168.1.x, you\u0026rsquo;ve found the cause.\nConfirm with routing table # On Mac/Linux netstat -nr | grep 192.168.1 # On Windows route print If you see multiple routes for the same subnet pointing to different interfaces, your OS doesn\u0026rsquo;t know which path to take.\nSolution 1: Allow Specific IPs Only (Quick Fix) The fastest and simplest solution is to route only specific devices through the VPN instead of the entire subnet.\nConfiguration Edit your WireGuard client config:\n[Interface] PrivateKey = YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY Address = 10.191.124.4/24 DNS = 9.9.9.9 [Peer] PublicKey = SERVER_PUBLIC_KEY Endpoint = YOUR_PUBLIC_IP:51820 # Instead of 192.168.1.0/24, use /32 for specific hosts AllowedIPs = 192.168.1.1/32, 192.168.1.23/32, 10.191.124.0/24 PersistentKeepalive = 25 What this does The /32 notation creates routes for individual IP addresses only. These specific routes take priority over your local network\u0026rsquo;s broader subnet route.\nLimitations ✅ Works from any network, even if it uses the same subnet ✅ No changes needed on the server side ❌ You must manually list each device you want to access ❌ New devices on your home network won\u0026rsquo;t be automatically accessible ❌ Dynamic IPs (DHCP) can break connections if they change (prefer assign IP address) Best for: Accessing a few specific services (Raspberry Pi, NAS, home server)\nSolution 2: Change Your Home Network Subnet (Permanent Fix) The robust solution is to change your home network to use a different subnet that won\u0026rsquo;t conflict with common networks.\nRecommended subnets 10.0.0.0/24 - Unlikely to conflict 192.168.2.0/24 - Common alternative 172.16.0.0/24 - Rarely used in home networks Steps to change Access your router (usually http://192.168.1.1) Navigate to LAN/DHCP settings Change the IP range from 192.168.1.x to 10.0.0.x (for example) Save and reboot the router Reconnect all devices (they\u0026rsquo;ll get new IPs automatically) Update WireGuard client config [Interface] PrivateKey = YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY Address = 10.191.124.4/24 DNS = 9.9.9.9 [Peer] PublicKey = SERVER_PUBLIC_KEY Endpoint = YOUR_PUBLIC_IP:51820 # Now you can use the entire subnet without conflicts AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.0/24, 10.191.124.0/24 PersistentKeepalive = 25 What this does By using a unique subnet at home, you eliminate any possibility of conflicts. When you connect to the VPN, your device knows that 10.0.0.x addresses should route through the tunnel because they don\u0026rsquo;t exist on your current local network.\nBenefits and trade-offs ✅ Access to all devices on your home network automatically ✅ Works reliably from any network worldwide ✅ New devices are immediately accessible ✅ Dynamic DHCP assignments don\u0026rsquo;t break connections ⚠️ Requires one-time router reconfiguration ⚠️ All devices need to reconnect once (automatic via DHCP) ⚠️ Need physical or remote access to your home network initially Best for: Anyone who regularly uses VPN to access their home network\nWhy not route everything through the VPN? You might consider using AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0 to route all traffic through the VPN, which would solve the subnet conflict. However:\nAll your internet traffic (Netflix, YouTube, browsing) goes through your home connection Slower performance due to double routing Unnecessary load on your home network Your home IP address is exposed for all activities This approach works but is overkill for accessing local resources.\nServer-side considerations Make sure your WireGuard server has proper forwarding configured. On your Raspberry Pi:\n# Check IP forwarding is enabled cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward # Should output: 1 # Verify iptables rules exist sudo iptables -t nat -L POSTROUTING -v -n # Should show MASQUERADE rules for your WireGuard subnet If these aren\u0026rsquo;t configured, the VPN tunnel works but traffic won\u0026rsquo;t route to your local network.\nWhich solution should you choose? Choose Solution 1 (specific IPs) if:\nYou only need to access 2-3 specific devices You can\u0026rsquo;t change your home network configuration right now You need a working solution immediately Choose Solution 2 (change subnet) if:\nYou regularly use VPN to access multiple home devices You want a reliable, permanent solution You can spend 10 minutes reconfiguring your router For most users who seriously use VPN to access their home network, changing the subnet is worth the one-time effort. It eliminates the problem permanently and provides the best long-term experience.\nConclusion Subnet conflicts are one of the most common but least obvious WireGuard issues. The connection appears to work (traffic flows, handshake succeeds), but routing fails silently. By understanding how your OS handles overlapping routes, you can quickly diagnose and fix the problem with either targeted routes or a subnet change.\nRemember: a working WireGuard connection doesn\u0026rsquo;t guarantee working routes to your destination network. Always verify your routing table matches your intentions.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/wireguard-subnet-conflicts/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYou\u0026rsquo;ve spent time setting up WireGuard on your Raspberry Pi, the connection shows as active, you see traffic in the WireGuard interface—but when you try to ping or access anything on your home network, nothing works. \u003cstrong\u003eWireGuard is setup but I can\u0026rsquo;t access anything\u003c/strong\u003e.
